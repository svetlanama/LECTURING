## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning hub for:

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: A fundamental matrix factorization technique used in linear algebra, with applications in image compression, dimensionality reduction, and data analysis.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical technique for dimensionality reduction that uses eigenvalue decomposition or SVD to identify principal components in data.
